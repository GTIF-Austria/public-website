## GTIF Capabilities 

Green Transition Information Factories (GTIF) produce geospatial content from Earth Observation (EO) data, quantifying and helping to understand the complexities of transitioning our energy and mobility sectors to Carbon neutrality. They generate input for the planning of sustainable cities and deliver factual data needed in the managing of climate change adaptation processes. 

GTIF content can be called-off via machine-to-machine interfaces and integrated into decision-making  chains. GTIF also feature interactive user interfaces for information discovery, analysis and judgement using cloud computing and cutting-edge analytics.

Service functions, called “GTIF Capabilities”, are grouped into the application domains “Energy Transition” , “Mobility Transition”, “Sustainable Cities”, “Carbon Accounting”, and “EO (Climate) Adaptation Services”. GTIF Capabilities are made for:

* Decision-makers to assess and monitor the effectiveness of policies  and evaluate political objectives and outcomes using GTIF-provided data, indicators and interactive exploration tools.
* Industry to develop novel solutions to foster the Green Economy, supported by space technologies, and connect to relevant national and international stakeholders within the wider GTIF ecosystem.
* Citizens to engage and understand the needs for their actions through interactive exploration tools and captivating scientific narratives across key Green Transition domains.

### Narratives

This Website provides a central location to present and describe the GTIF Austria Capabilities. The [currently available narratives](/narratives) are shown below.

<NarrativeGallery />


### Data Exploration

This Website also gives access to interactive graphical user interfaces (WebGUIs) for [exploration of the actual data and services](/explore) provided by the Capabilities.

### Contributions with Austrian Footing

The Capabilities accessible on this Website are of Austrian provenance or with a geographical coverage of Austrian territories. Mostly, they have been developed and coordinated under the Digital Twin Austria GTIF programme. Some are contributions to international GTIF programmes organized via projects of the European Space Agency.

All relevant GTIF Austria initiatives are invited to contribute their Capabilities using the tools available in the [GTIF Austria Workspace](https://dashboard.gtif-austria.gtif.eox.at/). Presently, the Workspace includes the Data Editor and Narrative Editor applications.

### Public and Commercial GTIF

Information about the suppliers behind each of the Capabilities is presented on this Website as well. In many of the shown cases the information made public on this Website is only a specimen of what a given Capability can supply under commercial plans. Users interested in the complete service scope and data coverages are invited to contact the respective supplier directly for further information about business arrangements.

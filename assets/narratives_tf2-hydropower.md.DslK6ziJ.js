As part of this study, an initial assessment of the potential for electricity generation from hydropower was already carried out. <p style="text-align:justify;"></p> This potential assessment examined the theoretical remaining potential, composed of new development potential and optimisation potential. The data basis for the NIP potential assessment was also discussed during stakeholder consultations. From this process, the need was derived to (i) extend the reference period for discharge data to the most recent climate period (1991–2020), (ii) assess the impacts of climate change on runoff using two climate scenarios, (iii) complete and update the dataset of hydropower plants, and (iv) further specify non-available river stretches. Those needs were considered in the assessment conducted in the course of the underlying study “Renewable Energy Potentials in Austria for 2030 and 2040.” The therein applied methodology was intended to be comparable to that of the ÖNIP [2], while providing a higher level of detail. Below we inform on the methodological concept and on derived outcomes. <h2 id="methodology" tabindex="-1">Methodology <a class="header-anchor" href="#methodology" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Methodology&quot;">​</a></h2><p style="text-align:justify;"></p> The Austrian National River Network (Gesamtgewässernetz, GGN), version v15, including rivers and catchment areas, formed the basis for modeling discharges for 1991–2020 and for projecting discharges for 2040 and 2070. The assessment of discharges was conducted at the level of so-called catchment areas, which represent the smallest spatial units defined within the GGN. For each catchment area, the main river was identified and downstream relationships were represented in a model-based manner. Based on this network of river reaches (river lines) and nodes (confluences or diversion points), a dataset of mean seasonal discharges was generated. <p style="text-align:justify;"></p> River sections on reporting water bodies under the Water Framework Directive (WFD), together with discharge data and information on catchment size, length, and elevation difference, were used to calculate the line-based runoff potential. <p style="text-align:justify;"></p> In a further step, river sections were subdivided. Criteria for this subdivision included non-available stretches, such as stretches requiring protection from a nature conservation perspective and other stretches with existing hydropower use or buffer functions. <h2 id="results" tabindex="-1">Results <a class="header-anchor" href="#results" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Results&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="theoretical-potential" tabindex="-1">Theoretical Potential <a class="header-anchor" href="#theoretical-potential" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Theoretical Potential&quot;">​</a></h3><p style="text-align:justify;"></p> Based on the precipitation runoff model, discharges were modeled for the selected climate scenarios RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 for 2040 and 2070. The deviation from other thematic areas, which focus on 2030 and 2040, is justified by the assessment that climate-induced changes in discharges between 2030 and 2040 are negligible. To provide a longer-term outlook, 2070 was therefore selected. <p style="text-align:justify;"></p> The results indicate that the monthly and annual precipitation totals projected by the climate models lead, in most catchments and scenarios, to an increase in average annual discharge by a factor of approximately 1.5. In addition, the projected rise in air temperature results in higher actual evapotranspiration; however, this increase is insufficient to fully offset the higher precipitation. Consequently, increased precipitation in most catchments leads to higher discharges and thus to higher theoretical hydropower potentials, as these are directly proportional to discharge. <p style="text-align:justify;"></p> A comparison of the developments under the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios shows that RCP 4.5 results in less extreme changes. RCP 4.5 assumes comprehensive greenhouse gas mitigation measures aimed at stabilizing global temperatures, whereas RCP 8.5 assumes only very limited mitigation efforts and therefore leads to substantially higher temperatures in the future. <p style="text-align:justify;"></p> An examination of the underlying monthly discharge values reveals a distinct seasonal pattern over the course of the year. In regions where marked decreases are projected under RCP 4.5, these reductions mainly occur during the summer half-year, while increases are projected for the winter half-year. However, the winter increases are insufficient to fully compensate for the summer deficits, resulting in an overall annual decrease. <p style="text-align:justify;"></p> Under RCP 8.5, the projections for 2070 indicate increases in both summer and winter discharges across almost all regions. These changes are primarily driven by substantial increases in runoff during the winter half-year. <h2 id="" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;!--{as=&quot;img&quot; data-fallback-src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nipargar/public-narratives/nipargar/tf2-hydropower/assets/nipargar/Figure-1-TF2-Hydropower-1769088616107.png&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GTIF-Austria/public-narratives/4da1d5afc2bd12a18dee46c6682bdd5a4534bbba/assets/Figure-1-TF2-Hydropower-1769088616107.png&quot; style=&quot; display:block; margin:auto;width: 70%; height: 70%;&quot;}--&gt;&quot;">​</a></h2><h6 id="figure-1-comparative-overview-of-austria-s-theoretical-hydropower-potential-for-the-current-period-and-under-rcp-4-5-and-rcp-8-5-up-to-2040-and-2070" tabindex="-1">Figure 1: Comparative overview of Austria’s theoretical hydropower potential for the current period and under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 up to 2040 and 2070. <a class="header-anchor" href="#figure-1-comparative-overview-of-austria-s-theoretical-hydropower-potential-for-the-current-period-and-under-rcp-4-5-and-rcp-8-5-up-to-2040-and-2070" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Figure 1: Comparative overview of Austria’s theoretical hydropower potential for the current period and under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 up to 2040 and 2070.&quot;">​</a></h6><p style="text-align:justify;"></p> In quantitative terms, the methodology for determining the line-based runoff potential for all of Austria yields a theoretical potential of 56.18 TWh/a for Austrian rivers based on discharges during the most recent climate period (1991–2020).

The RAV of pumped-storage power plants was not deducted from the potential; instead, river stretches with pumped-storage plants were assumed to be already developed. Subsequently, the estimated optimisation potential of existing hydropower plants was added to the technical potential. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, the technical potential values reported represent remaining potential figures excluding the performance data of existing plants. <p style="text-align:justify;"></p> The extrapolation of optimisation potential is based on an assessment provided by Österreichs Energie within the framework of the NIP. Based on optimisation projects already implemented, Österreichs Energie estimated the following ranges of efficiency improvements. In addition, the Austrian Small Hydropower Association (Kleinwasserkraft Österreich) contributed estimates for plants with capacities below 10 MW: <ul><li>Run-of-river plants &gt; 10 MW: 5–10%</li><li>Run-of-river plants &lt; 10 MW: approximately 30%</li><li>Storage hydropower plants &gt; 10 MW: 2.5–5%</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;"></p> These optimisation potentials were applied to the updated hydropower plant inventory compiled in the present study and calculated accordingly. For run-of-river plants for which no RAV data were available, an average optimisation potential corresponding to run-of-river plants below 10 MW was assumed. Due to the range of efficiency improvements for plants exceeding 10 MW, two values were derived and presented as minimum and maximum optimisation potentials. <p style="text-align:justify;"></p> Plants for which information on already implemented optimisation measures was available were excluded from this calculation. However, it must be assumed that the available data in this respect are incomplete and that some revitalisation measures already carried out could not be accounted for due to missing information. <p style="text-align:justify;"></p> An examination of the results shows that both climate models project an increase in technical potential of approximately 0.5 to 1.0 TWh/a. The hydropower potential reaches values similar to, though slightly higher than, those reported in the NIP; however, it is now more robust due to the underlying hydrological data being based on a thirty-year reference period. <h2 id="-2" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#-2" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;!--{as=&quot;img&quot; data-fallback-src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nipargar/public-narratives/nipargar/tf2-hydropower/assets/nipargar/Figure-3-TF2-Hydropower-1769088639017.png&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GTIF-Austria/public-narratives/f00890ed375dcf932adf102c2c6b11529b49e3fb/assets/Figure-3-TF2-Hydropower-1769088639017.png&quot; style=&quot; display:block; margin:auto;width: 70%; height: 70%;&quot;}--&gt;&quot;">​</a></h2><h6 id="figure-3-technical-potential-of-the-hydropower-technology-field-in-austria-excluding-existing-installations" tabindex="-1">Figure 3: Technical potential of the hydropower technology field in Austria, excluding existing installations. <a class="header-anchor" href="#figure-3-technical-potential-of-the-hydropower-technology-field-in-austria-excluding-existing-installations" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Figure 3: Technical potential of the hydropower technology field in Austria, excluding existing installations.&quot;">​</a></h6><h3 id="realisable-potential" tabindex="-1">Realisable Potential <a class="header-anchor" href="#realisable-potential" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Realisable Potential&quot;">​</a></h3><p style="text-align:justify;"></p> The realisable potential illustrates ranges of possible development pathways (Low,Medium,High) for hydropower in Austria. Based on the national energy balance for hydropower [3], recent developments and the pace of growth in hydropower generation were assessed. Over the period from 2010 to 2020, hydropower production in Austria increased by an average of 363 GWh per year. As this increase reflects actual generation and thus includes natural variability due to fluctuating discharges as well as new installations and optimisation measures. <p><b> Storyline – Low: Moderate Progress under Constrained Framework Conditions </b></p><p style="text-align:justify;"></p> In this storyline, the transformation of the energy system lags significantly behind long-term targets up to 2040. Austria continues to pursue its climate objectives; however, key barriers to the expansion of renewable energy are only gradually reduced. Approval procedures and spatial planning processes remain complex and time-consuming, delaying the implementation of new projects. Bottlenecks in administrative capacity and a lack of personnel at the regional level further slow procedures. Societal reservations toward certain technologies or locations, together with hesitant progress in expanding energy infrastructure, also constrain development. <p style="text-align:justify;"></p> Under the “Low” bandwidth, it is assumed that the growth rate is halved compared to the average rate observed over the past ten years. Under this assumption, the realisable potential would be reached in 2073 (RCP 4.5) or 2076 (RCP 8.5). <p><b> Storyline – Medium: Target-Oriented Development under Favourable Conditions </b></p><p style="text-align:justify;"></p> This storyline describes a continuous and structured transformation of the Austrian energy system in line with national and European climate targets. Renewable energy sources are expanded systematically, and key regulatory, economic, and societal barriers are gradually overcome. Legal frameworks are streamlined, permitting procedures become more efficient, and spatial planning increasingly aligns with energy and climate objectives. Grid infrastructure and storage systems are purposefully developed, improving the integration of variable generation. <p style="text-align:justify;"></p> The “Medium” bandwidth represents a continuation of the average growth rate observed over the past ten years (363 GWh per year). At this growth rate, optimisation of existing plants is assumed to be actively pursued alongside new developments, resulting in the full exploitation of the available potential by 2047 (RCP 4.5) or 2048 (RCP 8.5). <p><b> Storyline – High: Accelerated Transformation and Systemic Integration </b></p><p style="text-align:justify;"></p> Under this storyline, Austria achieves a comprehensive and dynamic energy transition. National and European climate targets are implemented consistently, and the transformation of the energy system is understood as a collective societal task. Framework conditions for hydropower expansion are highly favourable: stable political commitments, rapidly implemented legal simplifications in nature conservation and water law, and broad societal support provide the basis for accelerated development. <p style="text-align:justify;"></p> For the “High” bandwidth, it is assumed that the Renewable Energy Expansion Act (EAG) target of an additional 5 TWh by 2030 relative to 2020 is achieved and can be maintained at the same pace thereafter. Under this projection, the available hydropower potential would be fully exploited by 2040 through strongly accelerated new construction and extensive utilization of optimisation measures at existing plants. <h2 id="-3" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#-3" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;!--{as=&quot;img&quot; data-fallback-src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nipargar/public-narratives/nipargar/tf2-hydropower/assets/nipargar/Figure-4-TF2-Hydropower-1769088650933.png&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GTIF-Austria/public-narratives/60afcb5abdad1137f67afe0f6b2fe29099744675/assets/Figure-4-TF2-Hydropower-1769088650933.png&quot; style=&quot; display:block; margin:auto;width: 70%; height: 70%;&quot;}--&gt;&quot;">​</a></h2><h6 id="figure-4-realisable-hydropower-potential-presented-as-development-bandwidths" tabindex="-1">Figure 4: Realisable hydropower potential presented as development bandwidths. <a class="header-anchor" href="#figure-4-realisable-hydropower-potential-presented-as-development-bandwidths" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Figure 4: Realisable hydropower potential presented as development bandwidths.&quot;">​</a></h6><h2 id="-4" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#-4" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;!--{as=&quot;img&quot; data-fallback-src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nipargar/public-narratives/nipargar/tf2-hydropower/assets/nipargar/Figure-6-TF2-Hydropower-1769088664121.png&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GTIF-Austria/public-narratives/24095166723b4d9abb742a56e057a26415f7a6ba/assets/Figure-6-TF2-Hydropower-1769088664121.png&quot; style=&quot; display:block; margin:auto;width: 70%; height: 70%;&quot;}--&gt;&quot;">​</a></h2><h6 id="figure-5-overview-of-realizable-hydropower-potentials-the-technical-potential-tech-pot-is-based-on-the-2070-rcp-8-5-scenario" tabindex="-1">Figure 5: Overview of realizable hydropower potentials.

Consequently, the technical potential (remaining potential) is substantially lower than in other technology fields. The technical potential of the remaining river stretches, estimated at 4.50 to 5.52 TWh/a depending on the climate scenario, cannot realistically be fully exploited. The approval and implementation of hydropower projects depend on a wide range of additional economic framework conditions and local factors (political willingness, public acceptance, topographical conditions, etc.) and ultimately require case-by-case decisions. <p style="text-align:justify;"></p> Moreover, it must be considered that most of the most suitable river stretches have already been developed. In terms of efficiency—measured as the ratio of the number of plants to energy production—plants with an installed capacity exceeding 10 MW are the most effective. As shown in the inventory assessment, 182 such plants account for 87% of the existing firm energy (RAV). The remaining 13% is distributed among 4,876 plants with capacities below 10 MW, for which performance data were available. If it is therefore assumed that the potential of the remaining stretches would largely have to be exploited through small hydropower plants (SHP), an additional logistical challenge arises. On average, SHP installations have a firm energy of approximately 1.4 GWh/a. To exploit the calculated technical potential of the remaining stretches of 4.50 to 5.52 TWh/a, approximately 3,200 to 3,900 additional SHP plants would be required. This would theoretically increase the number of hydropower plants in Austria by about one third, which appears highly disproportionate relative to the potential energy gain. <p style="text-align:justify;"></p> Accordingly, the bandwidths presented above should be interpreted as a range of possible trajectories for hydropower development, with growth in hydropower generation expected to flatten over time. The calculated maximum optimisation potential of 5.27 TWh represents a theoretical upper bound; the actually achievable increase in production is likely to be lower. This is due not only to economic and local constraints but also to gaps in the available data on optimisation measures already implemented. Nevertheless, optimisation and maintenance of the existing hydropower fleet should be given the highest priority. Optimisation offers the advantage of utilizing existing infrastructure without the need to develop new sites through the construction of plants, transmission lines, and grid connections. As a result, investment costs can be reduced and additional environmental impacts avoided. <h2 id="references" tabindex="-1">References <a class="header-anchor" href="#references" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;References&quot;">​</a></h2><p style="text-align:justify;"></p>[1] Umweltbundesamt, Erzeugung von Erneuerbarem Strom und Biomethan, Bde. %1 von %2REP-0874, 2023. <p style="text-align:justify;"></p>[2] BMK, Integrierter österreichischer Netzinfrastrukturplan, 2024. <p style="text-align:justify;"></p>[3] Statistik Austria, „Energiebilanzen,“ [Online].

The accuracy of mapped solar panels depends on the quality of the source imagery. The higher the quality and resolution of the images, the higher the accuracy of the extracted data. During manual validation, no onside validation is performed. Validation is performed using ortho-imagery only.</p><h2 id="pricing" tabindex="-1">Pricing <a class="header-anchor" href="#pricing" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Pricing&quot;">​</a></h2><p>N Vision&#39;s goal is to provide fair offers which are tailored to customer’s specific needs.

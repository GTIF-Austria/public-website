While the individual analyses for renewable heat (e.g. air‑source heat pumps, aquathermy, shallow geothermal systems) and electricity (e.g. wind, PV) provide valuable insights into each technology, an integrated perspective was missing. <p style="text-align:justify;"></p> This comparative representation, targeting the electricity sector, was therefore developed to highlight the diversity of renewable energy sources, their spatial distribution, and their system‑specific constraints and advantages. This combined perspective equips planners and policymakers with the information needed to understand the relative contributions of different technologies and to identify suitable deployment pathways across national, regional, and municipal levels. <h2 id="aim" tabindex="-1">Aim <a class="header-anchor" href="#aim" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Aim&quot;">​</a></h2><p style="text-align:justify;"></p> The aim of this comparative visualization was to consolidate geospatially processed renewable energy potentials and present their roles within the future Austrian energy system side-by-side, with a focus on the electricity sector and the role of wind and PV therein. <p style="text-align:justify;"></p> Specifically, the comparison illustrates: <ul><li><p style="text-align:justify;"></p> the magnitude of each technological potential in relation to the others, </li><li><p style="text-align:justify;"></p> the geographical conditions under which each technology can be effectively deployed, and </li><li><p style="text-align:justify;"></p> the combined contribution of these technologies to long-term electricity sector decarbonization, indicating the share of wind and PV supply potentials on related electricity demand. </li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;"></p> By bringing these renewable electricity potentials together in a unified analytical view, the visualization directly supports energy planning activities and demonstrates how advanced geodata can form a robust basis for strategic decision making at various geographical scales. <h2 id="method" tabindex="-1">Method <a class="header-anchor" href="#method" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Method&quot;">​</a></h2><p style="text-align:justify;"></p> The comparative assessment is based on the harmonized outputs of the study Renewable Energy Potentials in Austria for 2030 and 2040, which provided geodata on energy potentials of multiple renewable energy sources. These datasets were integrated into a common methodological and spatial framework to allow direct comparison between technologies. <p style="text-align:justify;"></p> In addition, information on existing energy infrastructure—particularly electricity transformer stations—were incorporated and merged with relevant spatial‑planning data. <h2 id="about" tabindex="-1">About <a class="header-anchor" href="#about" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;About&quot;">​</a></h2><p style="text-align:justify;"></p> The underlying study, “Renewable Energy Potentials in Austria for 2030 and 2040,” was conducted on behalf of the Climate and Energy Fund and was financed with appropriations from the former Federal Ministry for Climate Action, Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovation and Technology (BMK). It was carried out under the leadership of AIT Austrian Institute of Technology GmbH (AIT), together with the Environment Agency Austria (UBA), Vienna University of Technology (TU Wien), AEE – Institute for Sustainable Technologies (AEE INTEC), and Energiewerkstatt. <p style="text-align:justify;"></p> AIT acts as provider for this service and largely builds on data provided by UBA and Energiewerkstatt. <p style="text-align:justify;"></p> EOX complements with its IT expertise, acting as host and front-end expert. `,28))],64)):c("",!0)])]))}});export{b as __pageData,v as default};

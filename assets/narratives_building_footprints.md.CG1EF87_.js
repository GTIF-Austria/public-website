As we focus exclusively on the built environment, we employ advanced spatial clustering algorithms to minimize the area of interest, creating an optimal trade-off between coverage and cost. We offer a two-step approach to building footprint monitoring:</p><ol><li><em>Monitoring based on Copernicus Sentinel II data</em>: This cost-effective solution covers wide areas and focuses primarily on change detection. This approach is particularly valuable for the GTIF capability &quot;urban heat islands - trend analysis,&quot; where understanding changes in the built environment helps predict heat island trends.</li><li><em>Detailed extraction from high-resolution data</em>: This premium service provides precise building footprints, detects new buildings, identifies changes to existing structures (such as extensions), and recognizes obsolete buildings.</li></ol><p>Both approaches can be combined in a workflow where changes are first detected using the monitoring service, and detailed information is extracted only for areas of interest. A decision layer can be implemented between these steps to trigger detailed extraction only when a certain threshold of changes is detected.

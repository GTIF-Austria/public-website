Cities, with built-up areas and extensive sealed surfaces, create heat hotspots, exacerbating thermal discomfort and health risks. Vulnerable groups - such as the elderly, children, and individuals with chronic health conditions - are especially affected, facing an increased risk of heat-related illnesses and mortality. At the same time, fluctuating temperatures drive dynamic energy demands. The growing need for cooling in summer and heating in winter places additional pressure on energy infrastructure, requiring more efficient supply management and forecasting, based on accurate temperature forecasts.</p><h2 id="the-challenge" tabindex="-1">the challenge <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-challenge" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;the challenge&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="forecast-air-temperature-on-a-spatial-scale-that-is-representing-urban-features" tabindex="-1">forecast air temperature on a spatial scale that is representing urban features <a class="header-anchor" href="#forecast-air-temperature-on-a-spatial-scale-that-is-representing-urban-features" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;forecast air temperature on a spatial scale that is representing urban features&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Accurate, high-resolution urban weather forecasts are essential for mitigating health risks, optimizing energy distribution, and enhancing overall urban resilience. Unfortunately, current weather forecast models, based on regional-scale meteorological data, lack the spatial resolution necessary to capture the fine-scale temperature variations caused by urban morphology. On a 3-dimensional grid, these models are computing values that are &quot;representative&quot; for each model grid box. What does that mean in practice? For downtown Vienna, the yellow lines represent the 2.5km model grid</p><p><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1484e60c-a587-45a1-b774-f18fa6b94b50" alt="ESA_Vienna_Austria_zoom_grid_disclaimer"><a href="https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2022/07/Vienna_Austria" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2022/07/Vienna_Austria</a></p><p>and this is the 2m air temperature [K] forecast for 16th of August 2022, 13UTC for the center grid cell <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d69fc74-2806-4acf-9adc-f8f3d8f4bbf1" alt="t2m_AROME_innerestadt_2020081613_zuschnitt"><br> based on GeoSphere Austria&#39;s current weather forecast model.</p><h2 id="our-solution" tabindex="-1">our solution <a class="header-anchor" href="#our-solution" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;our solution&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="tailor-made-high-resolution-temperature-forecasts-for-your-city" tabindex="-1">tailor-made high-resolution temperature forecasts for your city <a class="header-anchor" href="#tailor-made-high-resolution-temperature-forecasts-for-your-city" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;tailor-made high-resolution temperature forecasts for your city&quot;">​</a></h3><p>GeoSphere Austria provides the latest technology to forecast urban weather phenomena more detailed than typically available, with a fine spatial scale of 100 meters. Unlike standard weather models, this approach incorporates urban-specific data to deliver detailed forecasts at the district level. For the example of Vienna, this means that you will get that information for the center grid cell: <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9caad778-f68a-4808-859b-c32c278beacf" alt="t2m_25x25_innerestadt_2020081613_zuschnitt"></p><p>This advanced modelling approach can support a wide range of stakeholders, including:</p><p>• <strong>Public authorities</strong> and <strong>crisis managers</strong> to enhance disaster preparedness and response.<br> • <strong>Urban planners</strong> and <strong>policymakers</strong> to design heat-resilient and energy-efficient cities.<br> • <strong>Energy providers</strong> to optimize heating and cooling operations with more precise demand forecasting.</p><p>By improving weather information at an urban scale, we empower cities to better adapt to weather and climate extremes.</p><h3 id="workflow" tabindex="-1">workflow <a class="header-anchor" href="#workflow" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;workflow&quot;">​</a></h3><p>By integrating precise satellite-based data, air temperature (and derived variables) can be calculated on a 100-meter grid to simulate and forecast their spatial and hourly variations providing a database for informed decision-making.

This heat is available at different temperature levels and (depending on the source temperature) can be fed into heating networks either directly or via heat pumps. While the direct use of waste heat is already technically established, the substantial potential of low-temperature waste heat (&lt;50°C) from industry, commerce, and wastewater remains largely unused. <h2 id="methodology" tabindex="-1">Methodology <a class="header-anchor" href="#methodology" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Methodology&quot;">​</a></h2><p style="text-align:justify;"></p> The following sections provide only a condensed overview of the methodological concept used for calculating shallow geothermal energy and groundwater potentials. A comprehensive and fully detailed description of all methodological steps, assumptions, and data sources can be found in the full report. <h5 id="definition-and-scope" tabindex="-1">Definition and Scope <a class="header-anchor" href="#definition-and-scope" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Definition and Scope&quot;">​</a></h5><p style="text-align:justify;"></p> The methodological approach consists of two main steps. First, technical potentials were assessed using either bottom‑up or top‑down methods, depending on the characteristics of the industrial segment. Second, temperature levels were classified into two categories: heat at or above 50°C, which can be used directly (e.g., via heat exchangers), and heat below 50°C, which requires upgrading through large‑scale heat pumps. The temperature‑differentiated results also apply to anergy networks, as a temperature lift is generally needed at some point in any such system, regardless of its specific design. <p style="text-align:justify;"></p> The conversion of waste heat energy into thermal capacity is based on an assumed 4,000 full-load hours (FLH) per year. <h5 id="limitation-and-constraints" tabindex="-1">Limitation and Constraints <a class="header-anchor" href="#limitation-and-constraints" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Limitation and Constraints&quot;">​</a></h5><p style="text-align:justify;"></p> Technical suitability of waste heat utilisation is further restricted by spatial criteria. Only those areas located within an allowable routing distance are considered. The identification of feasible routing corridors was based solely on spatial proximity to existing or planned district heating networks. Legal, topographical, or environmental protection constraints (e.g., Natura 2000 sites, water protection zones, pipeline crossings) were not considered in the modelling. <p style="text-align:justify;"></p> Furthermore, only district heating demands within the same municipality were taken into account. Potentials that could be realised through inter-municipal utilisation of surplus waste heat are therefore not included in the present assessment. The potentials reported here thus represent conservative estimates, which could be increased in cases where coordinated infrastructure solutions are implemented. <p style="text-align:justify;"></p> The dynamic development of new heat sinks and district heating networks was incorporated using the heat demand scenarios of the Austrian Heat Map. <h5 id="industrial-waste-heat" tabindex="-1">Industrial Waste Heat <a class="header-anchor" href="#industrial-waste-heat" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Industrial Waste Heat&quot;">​</a></h5><p style="text-align:justify;"></p> The utilisation of industrial waste heat above 50°C for direct integration into district heating systems is technically well established. According to NEA 2023 [2], 9,2% of district heating already originated from industrial waste heat in 2020 [3]. In contrast, the use of low-temperature waste heat via heat pumps is still at an early stage of development. <p><strong>Methodology and Data Basis</strong></p><p>The data basis is derived from the project INXS – Industrial Excess Heat (2021–2023) [3], supplemented by the sector scenario Pathway of Industry (NEFI) [4], which provides projections for 2030 and 2040. Depending on the industrial segment, the following methodological approaches were applied in line with [5]:</p><ul><li><p style="text-align:justify;"></p> Bottom-up for energy-intensive facilities (data from environmental reports, EMAS, etc.) </li><li><p style="text-align:justify;"></p> Top-down for energy-extensive sectors (derived from statistical data and standardised energy indicators) </li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;"></p> The potential was classified according to source types (flue gases, waste/cooling water, machinery heat, condensation, other) and three temperature levels (&lt;50°C / 50–100°C / &gt;100°C). <p style="text-align:justify;"></p> Source temperatures were assumed to remain constant in the future, based on current conditions. For the assessment of potential related to direct integration into district heating networks, the classes 50–100°C and &gt;100°C were combined. <p><strong>Theoretical Potential</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;"></p> The theoretical potential corresponds to the total site-specific waste heat available, derived from the energy consumption of industrial processes using the following steps: <ol><li><p>Compilation of industrial energy consumption (by energy carrier),</p></li><li><p>Identification of waste-heat-relevant processes (including cooling systems, flue gases, mechanical losses),</p></li><li><p>Application of typical loss and recovery factors,</p></li><li><p>Allocation to temperature levels and source types.</p></li></ol><p style="text-align:justify;"></p> For sites without primary data, reference values from comparable facilities (sector, size, technology) were applied. Total potentials were calculated for the base year 2019 and extrapolated to 2030 and 2040 using the NEFI-POI scenario. <p style="text-align:justify;"></p> It is assumed that industrial waste heat can only be utilised if it can be fed into an existing or newly constructed district heating network. Exclusively decentralised (building-internal) uses are not considered in this assessment. <p style="text-align:justify;"></p> Two technical utilisation pathways are distinguished: <ul><li><p style="text-align:justify;"></p> <b>Direct use (≥50°C):</b> Injection of waste heat into the district heating network without additional temperature lifting, e.g., via heat exchangers. </li><li><p style="text-align:justify;"></p> <b>Heat pump utilisation (&lt;50°C): </b> Raising the temperature level using central large-scale compression heat pumps prior to injection into the district heating network. </li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;"></p> At this stage, neither spatial constraints (e.g., maximum pipeline distances) nor system-level limitations (e.g., maximum coverage shares) are considered. The theoretically maximum usable waste heat potential at the municipal level is capped by the local district heating demand. In addition, a theoretical potential not constrained by municipal-level heat demand is provided, which is relevant for regional or inter-municipal district heating systems. <p><strong>Technical Potential</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;"></p>To calculate the technical potential, the theoretical potential is limited by two constraints: <ol><li><p>Maximum distance to the next district heating network: Spatial modelling of excess heat is supplemented by a GIS-based calculation of a maximum routing distance to the next district heating network.</p></li><li><p>Maximum coverage shares: To represent the Low–Medium–High ranges of possible expansion pathways for 2030 and 2040, maximum coverage shares of district heating demand are defined for each utilisation pathway (Table 1).</p></li></ol><h6 id="table-1-maximum-coverage-shares-of-waste-heat-in-district-heating-networks" tabindex="-1">Table 1 Maximum Coverage Shares of Waste Heat in District Heating Networks <a class="header-anchor" href="#table-1-maximum-coverage-shares-of-waste-heat-in-district-heating-networks" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Table 1 Maximum Coverage Shares of Waste Heat in District Heating Networks&quot;">​</a></h6><h2 id="" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;!--{as=&quot;img&quot; data-fallback-src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nipargar/public-narratives/nipargar/t74-waste-heat-v2/assets/nipargar/Table1-TF74-WasteHeat-1769066364555.png&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GTIF-Austria/public-narratives/c98e435c849ca19099c0f65934e1d2801808cae0/assets/Table1-TF74-WasteHeat-1769066364555.png&quot; style=&quot; display:block; margin:auto;width: 70%; height: 70%;&quot;}--&gt;&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong>Realisable Potential</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;"></p> The realizable potential could not be quantified in a generic manner for two reasons. First, although several installations are already in operation and others are under construction, their number is still too limited to apply a market‑penetration model based on an S‑curve. Second, heat‑recovery projects depend heavily on project‑specific boundary conditions, which must be assessed individually for each case. <h5 id="waste-heat-from-wastewater-treatment-plants" tabindex="-1">Waste Heat from Wastewater Treatment Plants <a class="header-anchor" href="#waste-heat-from-wastewater-treatment-plants" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Waste Heat from Wastewater Treatment Plants&quot;">​</a></h5><p style="text-align:justify;"></p> Wastewater treatment plants provide predictable, stationary, and continuously available heat sources that can be effectively utilised through heat pumps. However, current utilisation levels remain marginal. <p><strong>Methodology and Data Basis</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;"></p> For each wastewater treatment plant, annual wastewater volumes were obtained from the EEA database (Waterbase 2019) [7]. <p style="text-align:justify;"></p> Projections for 2030 and 2040 were derived proportionally from population development according to the ÖROK population forecast at the NUTS-3 regional level. The calculation follows a bottom-up approach based on publicly available data. No validation with individual plant operators was conducted; consequently, the accuracy depends on the underlying data quality. <p><strong>Theoretical Potential</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;"></p> The theoretical potential corresponds to the total site-specific waste heat available. At this stage, neither spatial constraints (e.g., maximum pipeline distances) nor system-level limitations (e.g., maximum coverage shares) are considered. The theoretically maximum usable waste heat potential at the municipal level is capped by the local district heating demand. In addition, a theoretical potential not constrained by municipal-level heat demand is provided, which is relevant for regional or inter-municipal district heating systems. <p><strong>Technical Potential</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;"></p> The calculation of technical potential is based on the following assumptions: <ul><li><p style="text-align:justify;"></p> <b>Temperature profile: </b> summer 20°C / winter 10°C </li><li><p style="text-align:justify;"></p> <b>Temperature drop: </b> average 5 K (cooling) </li><li><p style="text-align:justify;"></p> <b>Reduction factor</b> (e.g., due to stormwater dilution): 30% </li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;"></p> Analogous to industrial waste heat below 50°C, it is assumed that heat recovery from wastewater treatment plants can only be achieved using heat pumps. Direct heat utilization is feasible solely through anergy networks. For the purposes of this potential assessment, it is therefore assumed that a heat pump is required. Utilization is only considered meaningful if a suitable heat sink (e.g., a district heating network) exists within an economically viable distance. <p style="text-align:justify;"></p> The modelling approach incorporates the previously introduced constraint of a maximum pipeline distance and is identical to the modelling applied to heat-pump-based recovery of industrial waste heat. <p style="text-align:justify;"></p> For the 2030 and 2040 scenarios, different levels of ambition regarding the achievable share of local heat demand (analogous to industrial waste heat) are assumed. <p><strong>Realisable Potential</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;"></p> The realizable potential could not be quantified in a generic manner for two reasons. First, although several installations are already in operation and others are under construction, their number is still too limited to apply a market‑penetration model based on an S‑curve. Second, heat‑recovery projects depend heavily on project‑specific boundary conditions, which must be assessed individually for each case. <h2 id="results" tabindex="-1">Results <a class="header-anchor" href="#results" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Results&quot;">​</a></h2><p style="text-align:justify;"></p> The technical potential incorporates the upper coverage limits of district heating demand across three bands (low–medium–high) as well as maximum pipeline distances to district heating networks. The modelling also accounts for changes in district heating demand toward 2030 and 2040 according to the WEM (With Existing Measures) 2023 heat demand scenario, as well as expected reductions in high-temperature industrial waste heat due to energy efficiency measures. <h5 id="direct-use-of-industrial-waste-heat-≥50°c" tabindex="-1">Direct Use of Industrial Waste Heat (≥50°C) <a class="header-anchor" href="#direct-use-of-industrial-waste-heat-≥50°c" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Direct Use of Industrial Waste Heat (≥50°C)&quot;">​</a></h5><p style="text-align:justify;"></p> The direct utilization of industrial waste heat at higher temperatures (≥50°C) is technically established and comparatively well exploited in Austria. As early as 2020, approximately 1.75 TWh/a of industrial waste heat was fed into district heating networks with a combined connection capacity of roughly 580 MW [1]. <p style="text-align:justify;"></p> Based on a regionally differentiated starting value derived from the model, the technical potential for directly utilized waste heat for feeding into district heating systems amounts to up to 3.4 TWh/a in 2030 and 3.6 TWh/a in 2040. <p style="text-align:justify;"></p> The theoretical potentials listed in (7.2 GWh/a) represent the total industrial waste heat potential in 2040 at temperatures ≥50°C, without considering recoverability. When these waste heat potentials are restricted by municipal-level district heating demand, the value decreases to 4.6 GWh/a. However, this calculation does not account for the possibility of utilizing waste heat across municipal boundaries via district heating, provided that suitable heat sinks can be accessed. <h2 id="-1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#-1" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;!--{as=&quot;img&quot; data-fallback-src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nipargar/public-narratives/nipargar/t74-waste-heat-v2/assets/nipargar/Figure1-TF74-WasteHeat-1769065788336.png&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GTIF-Austria/public-narratives/f1b74251c54677358ff65019d18b123de6200795/assets/Figure1-TF74-WasteHeat-1769065788336.png&quot; style=&quot; display:block; margin:auto;width: 70%; height: 70%;&quot;}--&gt;&quot;">​</a></h2><h6 id="figure-1-temporal-evolution-of-technical-potentials-for-industrial-waste-heat-utilized-directly" tabindex="-1">Figure 1 Temporal Evolution of Technical Potentials for Industrial Waste Heat Utilized Directly <a class="header-anchor" href="#figure-1-temporal-evolution-of-technical-potentials-for-industrial-waste-heat-utilized-directly" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Figure 1 Temporal Evolution of Technical Potentials for Industrial Waste Heat Utilized Directly&quot;">​</a></h6><h2 id="-2" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#-2" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;!--{as=&quot;img&quot; data-fallback-src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nipargar/public-narratives/nipargar/t74-waste-heat-v2/assets/nipargar/Figure2TF74WasteHeat-1769065846376.png&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GTIF-Austria/public-narratives/d171e9a2406f7eca92466930b7c0c2bb0bf23d97/assets/Figure2TF74WasteHeat-1769065846376.png&quot; style=&quot; display:block; margin:auto;width: 70%; height: 70%;&quot;}--&gt;&quot;">​</a></h2><h6 id="figure-2-identified-energy-potentials-for-directly-utilized-industrial-waste-heat" tabindex="-1">Figure 2 Identified Energy Potentials for Directly Utilized Industrial Waste Heat <a class="header-anchor" href="#figure-2-identified-energy-potentials-for-directly-utilized-industrial-waste-heat" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Figure 2 Identified Energy Potentials for Directly Utilized Industrial Waste Heat&quot;">​</a></h6><h5 id="austria-gtif-direct-utilization-of-industrial-waste-heat-≥50°c-potential" tabindex="-1">Austria GTIF - Direct Utilization of Industrial Waste Heat (≥50°C) Potential <a class="header-anchor" href="#austria-gtif-direct-utilization-of-industrial-waste-heat-≥50°c-potential" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Austria GTIF - Direct Utilization of Industrial Waste Heat (≥50°C) Potential&quot;">​</a></h5>`,92)),e[1]||(e[1]=t("iframe",{width:"100%",a:"",height:"450",style:{border:"0","border-radius":"12px"},loading:"lazy",allowfullscreen:"",referrerpolicy:"no-referrer-when-downgrade",src:" https://gtif-austria.info/explore? x=13.2674&y=47.9350&z=6.8857&template=light&indicator=excess_heat_dir_eepot_w23_wocc&datetime=2030-01-01 "},null,-1)),e[2]||(e[2]=a('<h5 id="low-temperature-waste-heat-50°c-from-industry-commerce-and-wastewater-treatment-plants" tabindex="-1">Low-Temperature Waste Heat (&lt;50°C) from Industry, Commerce, and Wastewater Treatment Plants <a class="header-anchor" href="#low-temperature-waste-heat-50°c-from-industry-commerce-and-wastewater-treatment-plants" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Low-Temperature Waste Heat (&lt;50°C) from Industry, Commerce, and Wastewater Treatment Plants&quot;">​</a></h5><p style="text-align:justify;"></p> At present, the direct utilization of industrial waste heat at higher temperatures (≥50°C) is technically well established and comparatively well exploited.

The spatial distribution of these potentials is concentrated in industrial centres and urban areas with existing network-based infrastructure and high heat demand density.

Contributing factors include the typically short distances to major heat demand centres, the favourable scaling between wastewater volumes and heat availability, and the already accounted-for spatial suitability embedded in the technical potential. <p style="text-align:justify;"></p> Barriers primarily relate to comparatively small plant capacities, which must remain economically viable despite high investment shares for screens, filters, wastewater heat exchangers, heat pumps, and pipelines. Additional challenges arise from water law requirements and seasonal fluctuations, for instance in tourism regions. Overall, from today’s perspective, a realization rate of 60–80% of the technical potentials appears plausible. <p><strong>Industrial Waste Heat (Direct Utilization and Heat Pump Utilization)</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;"></p> Industrial waste heat exhibits strong spatial concentration—particularly in the Mur–Mürz corridor, the Inn and Rhine valleys, and the metropolitan regions of Linz, Graz, and Vienna—and is highly dependent on industrial and economic developments. The technical potential was therefore derived through spatial modelling that accounts for heat demand densities, distance limitations, and infrastructural factors. The assumed upper limit for transmission distances (e.g., approximately 12 km for 100 MW) is conservative, as current projects in the Aichfeld region and in Graz already illustrate. The underlying INXS study identifies a total technical waste heat potential of 34.3 TWh/a without applying spatial constraints. Under the methodology used here, this value decreases to 9.4 TWh/a by 2040, following the application of spatial (maximum pipeline distance) and systemic (coverage limit) restrictions. ##### Assessment of Utilization Pathways <p><strong>Direct Utilization of Industrial Waste Heat (≥50°C)</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;"></p> Direct utilization demonstrates a high level of technological maturity, low system complexity, and strong spatial alignment with existing and planned district heating networks. At present, approximately 1.6 TWh/a are already in use, corresponding to roughly 43% of the technical potential. By 2040, a technical potential of 3.6 TWh/a is projected. <p style="text-align:justify;"></p> Experts estimate that 70–90% of this potential is realizable. This corresponds to a realizable potential of approximately 2.2–3.3 TWh/a by 2040. <p><strong>Heat Pump Utilization of Low-Temperature Waste Heat (&lt;50°C)</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;"></p> The technical potential for low-temperature waste heat amounts to 5.7 TWh/a by 2040, yet its exploitation is more challenging due to site-specific conditions. Contributing factors include dependence on suitable heat sinks, higher system complexity, and limited project experience and business models. <p style="text-align:justify;"></p> For wastewater treatment plants, the realizability is estimated at 60–80%, substantially higher than for industrial low-temperature waste heat, which is assessed at 30–50% due to process constraints, spatial characteristics, and thermal interactions. <p style="text-align:justify;"></p> In total, under current framework conditions, this corresponds to a realizable share of 35–55%, or 1.7–3.2 TWh/a by 2040. In the medium to long term, the expansion of anergy and low-temperature district heating networks could substantially enhance the feasibility of utilizing these potentials. <p style="text-align:justify;"></p> Table 3 summarizes the realizable potentials (based on qualitative expert assessment) by utilization pathway. <h6 id="table-3-qualitative-classification-of-realizable-waste-heat-potentials-for-various-utilization-pathways" tabindex="-1">Table 3 Qualitative Classification of Realizable Waste Heat Potentials for Various Utilization Pathways <a class="header-anchor" href="#table-3-qualitative-classification-of-realizable-waste-heat-potentials-for-various-utilization-pathways" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Table 3 Qualitative Classification of Realizable Waste Heat Potentials for Various Utilization Pathways&quot;">​</a></h6><h2 id="-5" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#-5" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;!--{as=&quot;img&quot; data-fallback-src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nipargar/public-narratives/nipargar/t74-waste-heat-v2/assets/nipargar/Table3-TF74-WasteHeat-1769067133253.png&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GTIF-Austria/public-narratives/a5725bd58b4ac1765e0fdc1444757b56e8e69831/assets/Table3-TF74-WasteHeat-1769067133253.png&quot; style=&quot; display:block; margin:auto;width: 70%; height: 70%; &quot;}--&gt;&quot;">​</a></h2><h5 id="summary" tabindex="-1">Summary <a class="header-anchor" href="#summary" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Summary&quot;">​</a></h5><p style="text-align:justify;"></p> Waste heat is a key resource in the transformation of network-based heat supply systems. The technical potential amounts to up to 9.4 TWh/a by 2040, with varying degrees of realizability depending on the specific utilization pathway. <p style="text-align:justify;"></p> Overall, a realizable potential of approximately 4.0–6.5 TWh/a can be derived.

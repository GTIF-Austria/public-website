This should contain data on the energy efficiency of individual buildings and the energy efficiency of the national building stock. Aggregated and anonymized data on the building stock should be publicly accessible and available in a machine-readable format. Access to the full energy certificates should be granted free of charge to owners and users. Those interested in buying or renting should also have free access.

It supports the identification of energy-related renovation potential of buildings. It achieves this by delivering on-demand digital cartographic and statistical products derived from time-series of high-resolution thermal satellite imagery processed in combination with bespoke “urban index” building stock information within a user-provided Area of Interest defined at street-level.</p><p>The Local Observer service can deliver thematic, geographically mapped data layers to regional and local data bases such as multi-purpose land cover and land use maps.

This map is intended to make the search for locations and areas much easier and, in the interests of identifying energy efficiency and renovation potentials within the building stock.</p><p>The EPeBLO map contains the building energy efficiency index valid for the local context. It is calculated based on the downscaled Land Surface Temperature (LST) data, fine grained information about the built environment, either directly calculated from earth observation data or already <a href="https://www.data.gv.at/katalog/dataset/bev_digitaleslandschaftsmodellbauwerkestichtag25012023" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">preprocessed building footprints</a> and local meteorological data.

The building energy efficiency index is calculated based on the effective temperature difference between remotely observed temperature and global temperature, assuming normal building usage and sufficient contrast between outdoor and indoor temperature (e.g. comparison in winter conditions).</p><p>Copernicus Sentinel-3 LST data freely available globally is downscaled using two distinct methods, including one that leverages the correlation between LST and various land cover indices (e.g., NDVI, NDBI, NDBSI, NDMI, MNDWI, SAVI) through a Random Forest regressor. This method progressively refines the resolution down to 30m, producing a cloud-optimized datacube with a daily thermal time series. The resulting data is integrated with climatological information to derive an energy efficiency index and supports statistical analyses such as yearly or monthly means of all generated data.</p><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/triebnigg/public-narratives/triebnigg/energy-performance-of-buildings/assets/triebnigg/LST-1749976008835.jpg" alt=""></p><p><em>Figure 2 – OpenStreetMap with selected area (a part of Paris, France) for downscaling (Left) and spatial distribution of LST at Paris, France on 19.09.2024 at 10:02 am.

As the assessment is based on satellite imagery, factors such as cloud coverage may influence the accuracy, and the spatial resolution is more suitable for evaluating groups of buildings rather than individual structures. Since the analysis is conducted from an aerial perspective, it does not account for thermal insulation on building sides or other obscured areas. The frequency of data updates depends on the availability of new satellite imagery. This service is designed as an initial assessment to highlight areas where thermal insulation improvements may be relevant.

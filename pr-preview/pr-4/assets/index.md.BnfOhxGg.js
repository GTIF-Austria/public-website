They generate input for the planning of sustainable cities and deliver factual data needed in the managing of climate change adaptation processes.</p><p>GTIF content can be called-off via machine-to-machine interfaces and integrated into decision-making chains. GTIF also feature interactive user interfaces for information discovery, analysis and judgement using cloud computing and cutting-edge analytics.</p><p>Service functions, called “GTIF Capabilities”, are grouped into the application domains “Energy Transition” , “Mobility Transition”, “Sustainable Cities”, “Carbon Accounting”, and “EO (Climate) Adaptation Services”. GTIF Capabilities are made for:</p><ul><li>Decision-makers to assess and monitor the effectiveness of policies and evaluate political objectives and outcomes using GTIF-provided data, indicators and interactive exploration tools.</li><li>Industry to develop novel solutions to foster the Green Economy, supported by space technologies, and connect to relevant national and international stakeholders within the wider GTIF ecosystem.</li><li>Citizens to engage and understand the needs for their actions through interactive exploration tools and captivating scientific narratives across key Green Transition domains.</li></ul><h2 id="narratives" tabindex="-1">Narratives <a class="header-anchor" href="#narratives" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Narratives&quot;">​</a></h2><p>This Website provides a central location to present and describe the GTIF Austria Capabilities.

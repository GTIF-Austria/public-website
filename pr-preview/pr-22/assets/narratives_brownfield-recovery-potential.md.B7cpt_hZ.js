However, municipalities and companies seeking to expand or relocate face increasing space constraints, particularly in metropolitan areas. To promote sustainability, the net resealing of commercial areas should be minimized, making the reactivation of underutilized sites—so-called brownfields—an essential strategy. These sites offer several advantages, as they are often already integrated into local supply networks, benefit from established infrastructure, and are easily accessible for employees.</p><p>Despite their potential, a major challenge remains: the lack of centralized and comprehensive data on the location, availability, and potential contamination of brownfields. While some municipalities maintain detailed records, others rely on fragmented and inconsistent information, making the efficient redevelopment of these sites more complex. Without a systematic approach, the full potential of brownfield revitalization remains underutilized.</p><p>Addressing this gap aligns with Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles and supports the United Nations&#39; Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11, which aims to &quot;make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable&quot; <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal11?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">UN SDGs</a>. Specifically, Target 11.3 promotes sustainable urbanization and efficient land use, aligning directly with brownfield redevelopment by preventing unnecessary urban sprawl. In the European Union, policies such as the Cohesion Fund and the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) actively support brownfield redevelopment to enhance environmental sustainability and economic revitalization (<a href="https://commission.europa.eu/ec-events/brownfield-redevelopment-eu-2019-04-05_en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">commission.europa.eu</a>). Implementing a structured approach to brownfield identification and assessment will enhance environmental responsibility, promote economic revitalization, and foster social well-being by transforming underutilized land into productive, sustainable spaces.</p><h2 id="solution-capability" tabindex="-1">Solution Capability <a class="header-anchor" href="#solution-capability" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Solution Capability&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The Brownfield Recovery Potential (BRP) Capability is the service which provides the answers to the above questions related to brownfields as described in the following.

This map is intended to make the search for locations and areas much easier and, in the interests of soil and climate protection, to direct the need for space to locations that have already been used, in particular to relieve pressure on the “green meadows” on the outskirts of town.</p><p>The BRP map contains the location and size of the places that are most likely classified as brownfields enriched with further meta- and geo-data. The backbone of the applied classification method is a ResNet50-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), pre-trained on remote sensing imagery via TorchGeo.
